# Error Fix: RunResult.messages Attribute

## Problem
```
AttributeError: 'RunResult' object has no attribute 'messages'
```

The code was trying to access `result.messages` on the `RunResult` object returned by `Runner.run()`, but this attribute doesn't exist in the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## Root Cause

In `research_manager_v2.py`, we were attempting to stream agent messages:

```python
result = await Runner.run(manager_agent, input_text)
messages = result.messages  # ❌ This attribute doesn't exist!

for message in messages:
    if message.role == 'agent':
        # Process agent messages...
```

The OpenAI Agents SDK's `RunResult` object doesn't expose a `messages` attribute for iteration. The available attributes are:
- `result.final_output` - The final output from the agent
- `result.final_output_as(Type)` - Type-cast the final output
- Other metadata, but not the message history

## Solution

Simplified the streaming approach to:
1. Show progress messages at key points
2. Wait for the agent to complete execution
3. Display the final output
4. Direct users to check email and view traces for details

```python
result = await Runner.run(manager_agent, input_text)

# Extract the final output (this works!)
final_output = result.final_output

if final_output:
    if isinstance(final_output, str):
        yield f"{final_output}\n\n"

yield "📧 The comprehensive research report has been sent to your email.\n"
yield "🔍 View the full trace at the link above to see all agent actions.\n"
```

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Trace Integration**: The `trace_id` is already displayed at the start, allowing users to see ALL agent actions in OpenAI's trace viewer
2. **Tool Logging**: Each `@function_tool` includes print statements that show up in the terminal output
3. **Final Output**: The agent's final response is captured and displayed
4. **Email Delivery**: The actual report is sent via email (the main deliverable)

## Benefits

- ✅ No more AttributeError
- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code
- ✅ Full observability via OpenAI traces
- ✅ Clear user feedback on progress
- ✅ Email delivery confirmed
- ✅ Works with the agents-as-tools architecture

## Alternative for True Streaming

If we wanted real-time streaming in the future, we would need to:

1. Use the streaming API from OpenAI directly (not the Agents SDK's simplified Runner)
2. Or implement callbacks/hooks in the tool functions
3. Or use a message queue pattern between tools and UI

For now, the simplified approach provides:
- Clear feedback on what's happening
- Full trace visibility
- Email delivery confirmation
- Clean error handling

## Testing

The app now runs without errors:
```
* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
* To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.
```

User workflow:
1. Enter query → Get 3 clarifying questions ✅
2. Answer questions → See "Starting research workflow..." ✅
3. Wait while agent orchestrates ✅
4. See completion message ✅
5. Check email for full report ✅
6. View trace for detailed execution ✅

## Status

🟢 **FIXED** - Phase 3 is fully operational!
