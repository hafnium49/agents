## Week 2 Day 2

Our first Agentic Framework project!!

Prepare yourself for something ridiculously easy.

We're going to build a simple Agent system for generating cold sales outreach emails:
1. Agent workflow
2. Use of tools to call functions
3. Agent collaboration via Tools and Handoffs

## Before we start - some setup:


Please visit Sendgrid at: https://sendgrid.com/

(Sendgrid is a Twilio company for sending emails.)

If SendGrid gives you problems, see the alternative implementation using "Resend Email" in community_contributions/2_lab2_with_resend_email

Please set up an account - it's free! (at least, for me, right now).

Once you've created an account, click on:

Settings (left sidebar) >> API Keys >> Create API Key (button on top right)

Copy the key to the clipboard, then add a new line to your .env file:

`SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxxx`

And also, within SendGrid, go to:

Settings (left sidebar) >> Sender Authentication >> "Verify a Single Sender"  
and verify that your own email address is a real email address, so that SendGrid can send emails for you.



```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace, function_tool
from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent
from typing import Dict
import sendgrid
import os
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Email, To, Content
import asyncio


```


```python
load_dotenv(override=True)
```




    True




```python
# Let's just check emails are working for you

def send_test_email():
    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    from_email = Email("hafnium49@gmail.com")  # Email("ed@edwarddonner.com")  # Change to your verified sender
    to_email = To("chemistry49@hotmail.co.jp")  # To("ed.donner@gmail.com")  # Change to your recipient
    content = Content("text/plain", "This is an important test email")
    mail = Mail(from_email, to_email, "Test email", content).get()
    response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail)
    print(response.status_code)

send_test_email()
```

    202


### Did you receive the test email

If you get a 202, then you're good to go!

#### Certificate error

If you get an error SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED then students Chris S and Oleksandr K have suggestions:  
First run this: `!uv pip install --upgrade certifi`  
Next, run this:
```python
import certifi
import os
os.environ['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = certifi.where()
```

#### Other errors or no email

If there are other problems, you'll need to check your API key and your verified sender email address in the SendGrid dashboard

Or use the alternative implementation using "Resend Email" in community_contributions/2_lab2_with_resend_email

(Or - you could always replace the email sending code below with a Pushover call, or something to simply write to a flat file)

## Step 1: Agent workflow


```python
instructions1 = "You are a sales agent working for ComplAI, \
a company that provides a SaaS tool for ensuring SOC2 compliance and preparing for audits, powered by AI. \
You write professional, serious cold emails."

instructions2 = "You are a humorous, engaging sales agent working for ComplAI, \
a company that provides a SaaS tool for ensuring SOC2 compliance and preparing for audits, powered by AI. \
You write witty, engaging cold emails that are likely to get a response."

instructions3 = "You are a busy sales agent working for ComplAI, \
a company that provides a SaaS tool for ensuring SOC2 compliance and preparing for audits, powered by AI. \
You write concise, to the point cold emails."
```


```python
sales_agent1 = Agent(
        name="Professional Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions1,
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

sales_agent2 = Agent(
        name="Engaging Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions2,
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

sales_agent3 = Agent(
        name="Busy Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions3,
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
)
```


```python

result = Runner.run_streamed(sales_agent1, input="Write a cold sales email")
async for event in result.stream_events():
    if event.type == "raw_response_event" and isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
        print(event.data.delta, end="", flush=True)
```

Now go and check out the trace:

https://platform.openai.com/traces

## Part 2: use of tools

Now we will add a tool to the mix.

Remember all that json boilerplate and the `handle_tool_calls()` function with the if logic..


```python
sales_agent1 = Agent(
        name="Professional Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions1,
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
)

sales_agent2 = Agent(
        name="Engaging Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions2,
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
)

sales_agent3 = Agent(
        name="Busy Sales Agent",
        instructions=instructions3,
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
```


```python
sales_agent1
```




    Agent(name='Professional Sales Agent', instructions='You are a sales agent working for ComplAI, a company that provides a SaaS tool for ensuring SOC2 compliance and preparing for audits, powered by AI. You write professional, serious cold emails.', prompt=None, handoff_description=None, handoffs=[], model='gpt-4o-mini', model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=None, top_p=None, frequency_penalty=None, presence_penalty=None, tool_choice=None, parallel_tool_calls=None, truncation=None, max_tokens=None, reasoning=None, metadata=None, store=None, include_usage=None, extra_query=None, extra_body=None, extra_headers=None, extra_args=None), tools=[], mcp_servers=[], mcp_config={}, input_guardrails=[], output_guardrails=[], output_type=None, hooks=None, tool_use_behavior='run_llm_again', reset_tool_choice=True)



## Steps 2 and 3: Tools and Agent interactions

Remember all that boilerplate json?

Simply wrap your function with the decorator `@function_tool`


```python
@function_tool
def send_email(body: str):
    """ Send out an email with the given body to all sales prospects """
    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
    from_email = Email("hafnium49@gmail.com")  # Email("ed@edwarddonner.com")  # Change to your verified sender
    to_email = To("chemistry49@hotmail.co.jp")  # To("ed.donner@gmail.com")  # Change to your recipient
    content = Content("text/plain", body)
    mail = Mail(from_email, to_email, "Sales email", content).get()
    sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail)
    return {"status": "success"}
```

### This has automatically been converted into a tool, with the boilerplate json created


```python
# Let's look at it
send_email
```




    FunctionTool(name='send_email', description='Send out an email with the given body to all sales prospects', params_json_schema={'properties': {'body': {'title': 'Body', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['body'], 'title': 'send_email_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f631296eca0>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True)



### And you can also convert an Agent into a tool


```python
tool1 = sales_agent1.as_tool(tool_name="sales_agent1", tool_description="Write a cold sales email")
tool1
```




    FunctionTool(name='sales_agent1', description='Write a cold sales email', params_json_schema={'properties': {'input': {'title': 'Input', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['input'], 'title': 'sales_agent1_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f631296d620>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True)



### So now we can gather all the tools together:

A tool for each of our 3 email-writing agents

And a tool for our function to send emails


```python
description = "Write a cold sales email"

tool1 = sales_agent1.as_tool(tool_name="sales_agent1", tool_description=description)
tool2 = sales_agent2.as_tool(tool_name="sales_agent2", tool_description=description)
tool3 = sales_agent3.as_tool(tool_name="sales_agent3", tool_description=description)

tools = [tool1, tool2, tool3, send_email]

tools
```




    [FunctionTool(name='sales_agent1', description='Write a cold sales email', params_json_schema={'properties': {'input': {'title': 'Input', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['input'], 'title': 'sales_agent1_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f6324170860>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True),
     FunctionTool(name='sales_agent2', description='Write a cold sales email', params_json_schema={'properties': {'input': {'title': 'Input', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['input'], 'title': 'sales_agent2_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f63340ce840>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True),
     FunctionTool(name='sales_agent3', description='Write a cold sales email', params_json_schema={'properties': {'input': {'title': 'Input', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['input'], 'title': 'sales_agent3_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f631296fce0>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True),
     FunctionTool(name='send_email', description='Send out an email with the given body to all sales prospects', params_json_schema={'properties': {'body': {'title': 'Body', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['body'], 'title': 'send_email_args', 'type': 'object', 'additionalProperties': False}, on_invoke_tool=<function function_tool.<locals>._create_function_tool.<locals>._on_invoke_tool at 0x7f631296eca0>, strict_json_schema=True, is_enabled=True)]



## And now it's time for our Sales Manager - our planning agent


```python
# Improved instructions thanks to student Guillermo F.

instructions = """
You are a Sales Manager at ComplAI. Your goal is to find the single best cold sales email using the sales_agent tools.
 
Follow these steps carefully:
1. Generate Drafts: Use all three sales_agent tools to generate three different email drafts. Do not proceed until all three drafts are ready.
 
2. Evaluate and Select: Review the drafts and choose the single best email using your judgment of which one is most effective.
 
3. Use the send_email tool to send the best email (and only the best email) to the user.
 
Crucial Rules:
- You must use the sales agent tools to generate the drafts ‚Äî do not write them yourself.
- You must send ONE email using the send_email tool ‚Äî never more than one.
"""


sales_manager = Agent(name="Sales Manager", instructions=instructions, tools=tools, model="gpt-4o-mini")

message = "Send a cold sales email addressed to 'Dear CEO'"

with trace("Sales manager"):
    result = await Runner.run(sales_manager, message)
```

<table style="margin: 0; text-align: left; width:100%">
    <tr>

            If you don't receive an email after running the prior cell, here are some things to check: <br/>
            First, check your Spam folder! Several students have missed that the emails arrived in Spam!<br/>Second, print(result) and see if you are receiving errors about SSL. 
            If you're receiving SSL errors, then please check out theses <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680620ec-3b30-8012-8c26-ca86693d0e3d">networking tips</a> and see the note in the next cell. Also look at the trace in OpenAI, and investigate on the SendGrid website, to hunt for clues. Let me know if I can help!
            </span>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### And one more suggestion to send emails from student Oleksandr on Windows 11:

If you are getting certificate SSL errors, then:  
Run this in a terminal: `uv pip install --upgrade certifi`

Then run this code:
```python
import certifi
import os
os.environ['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = certifi.where()
```

Thank you Oleksandr!

## Remember to check the trace

https://platform.openai.com/traces

And then check your email!!


### Handoffs represent a way an agent can delegate to an agent, passing control to it

Handoffs and Agents-as-tools are similar:

In both cases, an Agent can collaborate with another Agent

With tools, control passes back

With handoffs, control passes across




```python

subject_instructions = "You can write a subject for a cold sales email. \
You are given a message and you need to write a subject for an email that is likely to get a response."

subject_writer = Agent(name="Email subject writer", instructions=subject_instructions, model="gpt-4o-mini")
subject_tool = subject_writer.as_tool(tool_name="subject_writer", tool_description="Write a subject for a cold sales email")

html_converter = Agent(name="HTML email body converter", instructions=html_instructions, model="gpt-4o-mini")
html_tool = html_converter.as_tool(tool_name="html_converter",tool_description="Convert a text email body to an HTML email body")

```

```python
tools = [tool1, tool2, tool3]
handoffs = [emailer_agent]
print(tools)
print(handoffs)

You are a Sales Manager at ComplAI. Your goal is to find the single best cold sales email using the sales_agent tools.
 
Follow these steps carefully:
1. Generate Drafts: Use all three sales_agent tools to generate three different email drafts. Do not proceed until all three drafts are ready.
 
2. Evaluate and Select: Review the drafts and choose the single best email using your judgment of which one is most effective.
You can use the tools multiple times if you're not satisfied with the results from the first try.
 
3. Handoff for Sending: Pass ONLY the winning email draft to the 'Email Manager' agent. The Email Manager will take care of formatting and sending.
 
Crucial Rules:
- You must use the sales agent tools to generate the drafts ‚Äî do not write them yourself.
- You must hand off exactly ONE email to the Email Manager ‚Äî never more than one.

## Extra note:

Google has released their Agent Development Kit (ADK). It's not yet got the traction of the other frameworks on this course, but it's getting some attention. It's interesting to note that it looks quite similar to OpenAI Agents SDK. To give you a preview, here's a peak at sample code from ADK:

```
root_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_time_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Agent to answer questions about the time and weather in a city.",
    instruction="You are a helpful agent who can answer user questions about the time and weather in a city.",
    tools=[get_weather, get_current_time]
)
```

Well, that looks familiar!

And a student has contributed a customer care agent in community_contributions that uses ADK.

    2. **Provide Confirmation**: If everything looks good, please confirm if you would like to send the email in production mode to your contact list!


## Exercise Answers Summary

### Agentic Design Patterns Identified:
1. **Planning Pattern** - Sales manager orchestrates multiple agents
2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Multiple specialized agents work together
3. **Reflection Pattern** - Agents evaluate and select best outputs
4. **Tool Use Pattern** - Agents use tools to take actions
5. **Agent-as-Tool Pattern** - Agents can be used as tools by other agents
6. **Handoff Pattern** - Control passes between agents

### The Key Line (Workflow ‚Üí Agent):
```python
sales_manager = Agent(name="Sales Manager", instructions=instructions, tools=tools, model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

The **`tools=tools`** parameter is what transforms this from a pre-programmed workflow into a true agent. With tools, the LLM can **dynamically decide** which tools to call, in what order, and based on intermediate results - rather than following a fixed sequence.

### Enhanced Features Added:
- **`load_contact_list`** - Load bulk recipients
- **`personalize_email`** - Customize emails per recipient
- **`send_bulk_email`** - Mail merge functionality with test mode
- **`compliance_checker`** agent - Ensure regulatory compliance
- **`ab_tester`** agent - Compare email variants

These additions demonstrate how easily the agent framework can be extended with new capabilities!

## üöÄ HARD CHALLENGE: Automated Reply Handling with SendGrid Webhooks

This implementation creates a complete webhook system that:
1. Receives replies via SendGrid's Inbound Parse webhook
2. Tracks conversation threads in a database
3. Uses an AI agent to generate contextual responses

       1. Open a terminal
       2. cd 2_openai
       3. uv run python webhook_server.py


### Step 7: SendGrid Inbound Parse Configuration Guide

To enable automated reply handling, you need to configure SendGrid's Inbound Parse webhook:

#### **A. Expose Your Local Server (Development)**

1. **Install ngrok**: Download from https://ngrok.com/
2. **Run ngrok**: `ngrok http 5000`
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL**: You'll get something like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

#### **B. Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse**

1. Go to **SendGrid Dashboard**: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Inbound Parse** ‚Üí **Add Host & URL**
3. Configure:
   - **Domain**: Use your verified domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - **Subdomain**: Create a subdomain for replies (e.g., `reply`)
   - **URL**: Your ngrok URL + `/webhook/inbound` (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook/inbound`)
   - **Check**: "POST the raw, full MIME message"
4. Click **Add**

#### **C. Update DNS Records**

```
Type: MX
Host: reply (or your chosen subdomain)
Value: mx.sendgrid.net
Priority: 10
```

#### **D. Set Reply-To Address**

When sending emails, use the reply subdomain as your reply-to address:
```python
from_email = Email("noreply@yourdomain.com")
reply_to = Email("reply@yourdomain.com")  # This routes to your webhook!
```

#### **E. Production Deployment**

For production, deploy your webhook server to:
- **AWS Lambda** + API Gateway
- **Google Cloud Run**
- **Heroku**
- **Railway.app**
- **Any VPS** with a public IP

### üéâ HARD CHALLENGE COMPLETE!

You now have a complete automated email reply system with:

#### ‚úÖ **What We Built:**

1. **üìä Conversation Database** - SQLite database tracking all email threads
2. **ü§ñ AI Reply Agent** - Contextual response generation based on conversation history
3. **üîÑ Webhook Server** - Flask app receiving SendGrid inbound emails
4. **üì§ Tracked Email Sending** - Every outbound email is tracked with unique thread IDs
5. **üí¨ Automated Responses** - AI analyzes replies and generates appropriate responses
6. **üîç Conversation Viewer** - Dashboard to monitor all conversations

#### üöÄ **How It Works End-to-End:**

```
1. Send Cold Email ‚Üí Tracked in DB with Thread ID
        ‚Üì
2. Recipient Replies ‚Üí SendGrid Inbound Parse Webhook
        ‚Üì
3. Webhook Receives Email ‚Üí Extracts sender, body, thread
        ‚Üì
4. Load Conversation History ‚Üí From Database
        ‚Üì
5. AI Agent Analyzes Context ‚Üí Generates appropriate reply
        ‚Üì
6. Send Automated Response ‚Üí Via SendGrid API
        ‚Üì
7. Save to Database ‚Üí Both inbound and outbound messages
        ‚Üì
8. Loop Continues ‚Üí For each subsequent reply
```

#### üì¶ **Files Created:**

- `email_conversations.db` - SQLite database with conversations and messages
- `webhook_server.py` - Flask webhook server for receiving emails
- Enhanced notebook cells with database helpers and agents

#### üéØ **Production Considerations:**

1. **Security**: Add authentication to webhook endpoint
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
3. **Error Handling**: Retry logic for failed email sends
4. **Monitoring**: Log all interactions and errors
5. **Testing**: A/B test different AI prompt strategies
6. **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/CAN-SPAM compliance with opt-out handling
7. **Scaling**: Use async workers (Celery) for high volume

#### üîß **Next Steps to Deploy:**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv pip install flask ngrok

# 2. Run the webhook server
cd 2_openai
uv run python webhook_server.py

# 3. In another terminal, expose with ngrok
ngrok http 5000

# 4. Configure SendGrid Inbound Parse with ngrok URL
# 5. Send a test email and watch the magic! ‚ú®
```

This is a production-ready foundation for an autonomous SDR system! üéä
