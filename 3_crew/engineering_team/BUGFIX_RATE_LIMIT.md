# Bug Fix: Anthropic Rate Limit Error (20,000 tokens/min)

## Issue

```
litellm.exceptions.RateLimitError: AnthropicException -
{"type":"error","error":{"type":"rate_limit_error",
"message":"This request would exceed the rate limit for your organization
of 20,000 input tokens per minute."}}
```

**Symptom:** Test task fails after 18+ Code Interpreter tool calls, consuming entire token budget.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why It Happened

1. **Test Engineer had Code Execution enabled**
   - Each Code Interpreter call includes full task context (~1000-2000 tokens)
   - Agent was iteratively testing code, making 18+ calls
   - Total: ~20,000+ tokens in under 1 minute

2. **Agent Retry Loop**
   - Test engineer tried to validate tests by running them
   - Failures triggered retries with full context each time
   - Exponential token consumption

3. **No Prevention Mechanism**
   - Code execution was unnecessary for test writing
   - Crew had `max_rpm=30` but no token-aware limiting

### Why Switching to GPT-4o-mini Failed Previously

GPT-4o-mini outputs escape sequences (`\n`) instead of actual newlines:
```python
# GPT-4o-mini output (invalid):
"def test():\n    pass\n"

# Expected output (valid):
"def test():
    pass
"
```

This failed the syntax guardrail (`ast.parse` can't parse escaped strings).

## Solution Implemented

### Part 1: **Disable Code Execution for Test Engineer** ✅

**File:** [crew.py](src/engineering_team/crew.py#L93-L100)

**Before:**
```python
@agent
def test_engineer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config['test_engineer'],
        verbose=True,
        allow_code_execution=True,       # ← PROBLEM
        code_execution_mode="safe",
        max_execution_time=500,
        max_retry_limit=3
    )
```

**After:**
```python
@agent
def test_engineer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config['test_engineer'],
        verbose=True,
        # Code execution disabled to prevent token-heavy Code Interpreter loops
        # Test engineer writes tests but doesn't execute them
        # Syntax validation via guardrail is sufficient for quality control
    )
```

**Impact:**
- Token consumption: **-90%** (1-2 LLM calls vs 18+)
- Test quality: Still validated by syntax guardrail
- Execution speed: Faster (no iterative testing loops)

### Part 2: **Enhanced Guardrail for Escape Sequences** ✅

**File:** [crew.py](src/engineering_team/crew.py#L12-L34)

**Before:**
```python
def guard_raw_python(result) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    out = result.raw if hasattr(result, 'raw') else str(result)

    if "```" in out:
        return (False, "Remove markdown fences")

    return (True, out)  # ← No syntax validation or escape handling
```

**After:**
```python
def guard_raw_python(result) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    """
    Guardrail with escape sequence handling and syntax validation.
    """
    out = result.raw if hasattr(result, 'raw') else str(result)

    if "```" in out:
        return (False, "Remove markdown fences; output must be raw Python code")

    # Fix escape sequences - some LLMs output literal \n instead of newlines
    if '\\n' in out or '\\t' in out:
        out = out.replace('\\n', '\n').replace('\\t', '\t').replace('\\\\', '\\')

    # Validate Python syntax
    try:
        ast.parse(out)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        return (False, f"Invalid Python syntax: {str(e)}")

    return (True, out)
```

**Impact:**
- GPT-4o-mini now viable as fallback LLM
- Better error messages for syntax issues
- More robust handling of diverse LLM outputs

### Part 3: **Clearer Task Instructions** ✅

**File:** [tasks.yaml](src/engineering_team/config/tasks.yaml#L42-L55)

**Added:**
```yaml
test_task:
  expected_output: >
    CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
    - Output ONLY raw Python code without markdown formatting
    - Use actual newlines and indentation (not escape sequences like \n or \t)
    - The output must be syntactically valid Python
    - Do NOT use literal backslash-n (\n) - use actual line breaks
```

**Impact:**
- Explicit guidance prevents escape sequence outputs
- Reduces guardrail retry attempts
- Better compliance across different LLMs

## Verification Tests

### Guardrail Tests (All Passing ✅)

```bash
uv run python -c "from engineering_team.crew import guard_raw_python; ..."
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Test 1 (normal newlines): Valid
- ✅ Test 2 (escaped `\n`): Converted and valid
- ✅ Test 3 (markdown fences): Rejected with clear error
- ✅ Test 4 (syntax error): Detected and rejected

### Expected Behavior After Fix

```
Test Task Execution:
├── Backend Engineer → Creates accounts.py (3 tool calls) ✅
├── Test Engineer → Creates test_accounts.py (1-2 calls) ✅ (was 18+)
│   └── Guardrail validates syntax ✅
├── Frontend Engineer → Creates app.py (2-3 calls) ✅
└── Other tasks complete normally ✅

Token Usage:
- Before: ~20,000+ tokens/min (rate limit exceeded) ❌
- After:  ~5,000-8,000 tokens/min (well under limit) ✅
```

## Fallback Strategy (If Still Issues)

If rate limits persist after these changes:

### Option A: Switch Test Engineer to GPT-4o (More Expensive)
```yaml
# agents.yaml line 47
test_engineer:
  llm: gpt-4o  # More expensive but reliable
```

### Option B: Switch to GPT-4o-mini (Cheaper, Now Compatible)
```yaml
# agents.yaml line 47
test_engineer:
  llm: gpt-4o-mini  # Now works thanks to escape handling
```

### Option C: Add Rate Limit Retry Logic
```python
# crew.py
@crew
def crew(self) -> Crew:
    return Crew(
        agents=self.agents,
        tasks=self.tasks,
        max_rpm=15,  # Reduce from 30 to be more conservative
        # Add litellm retry settings if needed
    )
```

## Key Takeaways

### What We Learned

1. **Code Execution ≠ Code Quality**
   - Test engineer doesn't need to RUN tests to WRITE them
   - Syntax validation is sufficient for quality control
   - Execution can be done later by the user

2. **LLM Output Varies**
   - GPT-4o-mini outputs escape sequences
   - Claude Sonnet outputs proper newlines
   - Guardrails must handle both formats

3. **Token Management is Critical**
   - Code Interpreter is expensive (full context per call)
   - Retry loops can quickly exhaust rate limits
   - Proactive prevention > reactive handling

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Disable code execution for agents that don't need it
- Use syntax validation via guardrails
- Handle diverse LLM output formats
- Add explicit formatting instructions to tasks

❌ **DON'T:**
- Enable code execution unless absolutely necessary
- Assume all LLMs format output identically
- Rely solely on rate limits without prevention
- Skip syntax validation when disabling execution
