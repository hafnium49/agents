### New to Notebooks like this one? Head over to the guides folder!

Just to check you've already added the Python and Jupyter extensions to Cursor, if not already installed:
- Open extensions (View >> extensions)
- Search for python, and when the results show, click on the ms-python one, and Install it if not already installed
- Search for jupyter, and when the results show, click on the Microsoft one, and Install it if not already installed  
Then View >> Explorer to bring back the File Explorer.

And then:
1. Click where it says "Select Kernel" near the top right, and select the option called `.venv (Python 3.12.9)` or similar, which should be the first choice or the most prominent choice. You may need to choose "Python Environments" first.
2. Click in each "cell" below, starting with the cell immediately below this text, and press Shift+Enter to run
3. Enjoy!

After you click "Select Kernel", if there is no option like `.venv (Python 3.12.9)` then please do the following:  
1. On Mac: From the Cursor menu, choose Settings >> VS Code Settings (NOTE: be sure to select `VSCode Settings` not `Cursor Settings`);  
On Windows PC: From the File menu, choose Preferences >> VS Code Settings(NOTE: be sure to select `VSCode Settings` not `Cursor Settings`)  
2. In the Settings search bar, type "venv"  
3. In the field "Path to folder with a list of Virtual Environments" put the path to the project root, like C:\Users\username\projects\agents (on a Windows PC) or /Users/username/projects/agents (on Mac or Linux).  
And then try again.

Having problems with missing Python versions in that list? Have you ever used Anaconda before? It might be interferring. Quit Cursor, bring up a new command line, and make sure that your Anaconda environment is deactivated:    
`conda deactivate`  
And if you still have any problems with conda and python versions, it's possible that you will need to run this too:  
`conda config --set auto_activate_base false`  
and then from within the Agents directory, you should be able to run `uv python list` and see the Python 3.12 version.


```python
# First let's do an import. If you get an Import Error, double check that your Kernel is correct..

from dotenv import load_dotenv

```


```python
# Next it's time to load the API keys into environment variables
# If this returns false, see the next cell!

load_dotenv(override=True)
```




    True



### Wait, did that just output `False`??

If so, the most common reason is that you didn't save your `.env` file after adding the key! Be sure to have saved.

Also, make sure the `.env` file is named precisely `.env` and is in the project root directory (`agents`)

By the way, your `.env` file should have a stop symbol next to it in Cursor on the left, and that's actually a good thing: that's Cursor saying to you, "hey, I realize this is a file filled with secret information, and I'm not going to send it to an external AI to suggest changes, because your keys should not be shown to anyone else."

    If two trains start from two stations 300 miles apart and travel toward each other, one at 40 miles per hour and the other at 60 miles per hour, a bird starts flying from the front of the first train to the second train at 80 miles per hour, turning around instantly each time it reaches a train until the trains meet. How far will the bird have flown when the trains meet?



```python
# form a new messages list
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": question}]

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages=messages
)

answer = response.choices[0].message.content
print(answer)

```

    Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:
    
    **Given:**
    
    - Distance between two stations = 300 miles
    - Train A speed = 40 mph
    - Train B speed = 60 mph
    - Bird speed = 80 mph, flies back and forth between the two trains, turning instantly at each train until the trains meet.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 1: Find the time until the trains meet
    
    The two trains are moving toward each other:
    
    - Combined speed = 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph
    - Distance = 300 miles
    
    Time to meet \( t \):
    
    \[
    t = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{100 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
    \]
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 2: Find how far the bird flies in that time
    
    The bird flies continuously at 80 mph for the entire 3 hours (because it instantly turns around when it reaches a train and continues flying).
    
    Thus, distance the bird flies:
    
    \[
    \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles}
    \]
    
    ---
    
    ### **Final Answer:**
    
    \[
    \boxed{240 \text{ miles}}
    \]
    
    The bird will have flown **240 miles** by the time the trains meet.



```python
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

**Given:**

- Distance between two stations = 300 miles
- Train A speed = 40 mph
- Train B speed = 60 mph
- Bird speed = 80 mph, flies back and forth between the two trains, turning instantly at each train until the trains meet.

---

### Step 1: Find the time until the trains meet

The two trains are moving toward each other:

- Combined speed = 40 mph + 60 mph = 100 mph
- Distance = 300 miles

Time to meet \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{100 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find how far the bird flies in that time

The bird flies continuously at 80 mph for the entire 3 hours (because it instantly turns around when it reaches a train and continues flying).

Thus, distance the bird flies:

\[
\text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles}
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{240 \text{ miles}}
\]

The bird will have flown **240 miles** by the time the trains meet.

    BUSINESS AREA:
    Supply Chain Management – leveraging Agentic AI to autonomously optimize inventory levels, logistics, and demand forecasting for enhanced efficiency and cost reduction.
    
    PAIN POINT:
    **Pain-point:**  
    **Dynamic, Real-time Inventory Optimization Under Complex, Fast-Changing Conditions**
    
    In supply chain management, companies often struggle to maintain optimal inventory levels due to highly volatile and unpredictable demand patterns, supply disruptions, and complex lead times across multiple tiers of suppliers. Traditional inventory optimization approaches are typically rule-based or rely on periodic, batch-processed forecasts that cannot promptly adjust to real-time changes such as sudden demand surges, supplier delays, or logistical bottlenecks.
    
    This leads to two major issues:
    
    1. **Excess Inventory and High Holding Costs:** Overstocking buffers against uncertainty, but results in costly warehousing, spoilage (for perishables), and capital tying effects.
    2. **Stockouts and Service Level Failures:** Understocking risks lost sales, delayed fulfillment, and diminished customer satisfaction.
    
    The challenge is amplified in multi-echelon supply chains where inventory decisions at one node affect others downstream or upstream, requiring continuous, coordinated adjustments across locations, SKUs, and suppliers.
    
    ---
    
    **Why This is Ripe for an Agentic AI Solution:**
    
    - **Autonomous, Real-time Decision Making:** Agentic AI can continuously monitor data streams from sales, market trends, supplier status, transportation networks, and external indicators (weather, geopolitical events) to proactively adjust inventory targets without manual intervention.
    - **Multi-Objective Optimization:** The AI can balance conflicting goals (cost reduction, service levels, risk mitigation) dynamically based on changing business priorities or external pressures.
    - **Learning and Adaptation:** By interacting autonomously with ERP systems, suppliers, and logistics providers, the Agentic AI can test and learn the effectiveness of different replenishment policies and dynamically adapt in complex, non-linear environments.
    - **Coordination Across Network Tiers:** Agents representing different nodes or functions can negotiate and synchronize inventory decisions to optimize the entire supply chain holistically, rather than in silos.
    
    ---
    
    **Example Scenario:**  
    An Agentic AI system detects an unexpected demand spike for a product line in a region due to a competitor’s stockout and autonomously recalculates optimal inventory levels, communicates with upstream suppliers about expediting shipments, reroutes inbound logistics to faster transportation modes, and preemptively adjusts downstream warehouse allocations, all while balancing overall supply chain cost and service objectives dynamically and without human lag.
    
    ---
    
    In summary, the pain-point of maintaining near-optimal inventory levels in highly dynamic, multi-tier supply chains—with minimal human oversight and maximal responsiveness—is complex, costly, and ripe to be revolutionized by autonomous Agentic AI solutions.
    
    AGENTIC AI SOLUTION:
    Certainly! Below is a detailed proposal for an **Agentic AI solution** tailored to dynamically optimize multi-echelon inventory in real-time under complex, fast-changing supply chain conditions.
    
    ---
    
    ## Proposed Agentic AI Solution for Dynamic, Real-time Inventory Optimization
    
    ### **Core Concept:**  
    A decentralized, multi-agent system where specialized AI agents autonomously collaborate and negotiate across tiers and functions of the supply chain, continuously ingesting streaming data and making coordinated decisions that optimize inventory levels holistically, balancing cost, service levels, and risk in real time.
    
    ---
    
    ## Key Components & Architecture
    
    ### 1. **Agent Types and Roles**
    
    | Agent Type                          | Responsibilities & Capabilities                                                  |
    |-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Demand Sensing Agent**           | - Continuously monitors POS data, market trends, competitor info, social media, weather, and macro-events.<br>- Provides ultra-short-term demand forecasts including uncertainty quantification and identifies demand spikes or drops. |
    | **Inventory Optimization Agent**  | - Receives demand signals and real inventory levels from nodes.<br>- Runs multi-echelon inventory optimization algorithms considering cost, lead time variability, perishability, and SKU relationships.<br>- Suggests optimal order quantities and safety stock dynamically.|
    | **Supply Risk Agent**              | - Monitors supplier KPIs, order fulfillment reliability, geopolitical risks, transportation disruptions, and raw material availability in real-time.<br>- Estimates risk-adjusted lead times and recommends alternate sourcing or order adjustments.|
    | **Logistics Coordination Agent**  | - Interfaces with transport providers and logistics partners.<br>- Dynamically re-routes shipments, changes transportation modes (e.g., air vs. sea), and schedules expedited delivery when needed.<br>- Estimates ETA (estimated time of arrival) disruptions and informs Inventory Optimization Agent.|
    | **Negotiation & Contracting Agent**| - Manages procurement contracts and supplier negotiations.<br>- Can autonomously request expediting fees, renegotiate lead times, or adjust order sizes with suppliers.<br>- Coordinates penalties, incentives, and priority allocations.|
    | **Warehouse & Distribution Agent**| - Optimizes warehouse allocations, internal transfers, and cross-docking operations.<br>- Adjusts allocation to downstream nodes based on anticipated demand and inbound supply changes. |
    | **Central Coordination Agent (Supervisor)**| - Oversees negotiation protocols and conflict resolution between agents.<br>- Ensures alignment with company-wide KPIs and constraints.<br>- Adjusts agent priorities in response to strategic business objectives and external disruptions. |
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Data Inputs & Integration**
    
    - **Real-time Data Sources:** POS sales, ERP stock levels, supplier order acknowledgments, transportation tracking systems, weather feeds, market indicators, social media sentiment analysis, geopolitical news.
    - **Systems Integration:** Bi-directional API connections with ERP, Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), Transportation Management Systems (TMS), Supplier Portals.
    - **Event Streams:** Agents consume event streams enabling reactive and proactive behavior rather than batch updates.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration and Decision Flow**
    
    1. The **Demand Sensing Agent** detects an unexpected sales spike for SKU X in region R and alerts the Inventory Optimization Agent immediately.
    2. The **Inventory Optimization Agent** re-runs optimization models considering updated forecasts, current inventories, demand uncertainty, and historical replenishment policies:
        - Calculates new order quantities and safety stocks per node.
        - Identifies potential bottlenecks (e.g., upstream constraints).
    3. The **Supply Risk Agent** evaluates upstream suppliers for ability to meet suddenly increased order volumes:
        - Detects supplier delays or capacity shortfalls.
        - Suggests risk mitigating actions, e.g., alternative suppliers.
    4. The **Negotiation & Contracting Agent** autonomously engages pertinent suppliers to expedite orders, negotiate priority slots, or request emergency shipments.
    5. The **Logistics Coordination Agent** designs new inbound shipment plans:
        - Chooses faster transportation modes.
        - Prepares contingency routing plans.
    6. The **Warehouse & Distribution Agent** recalculates allocation plans for downstream warehouses, preparing them to receive and distribute increased SKU volumes.
    7. The **Central Coordination Agent** ensures agent decisions do not conflict and collectively maximize overall supply chain efficiency under the company’s cost-service tradeoff objective.
    
    This feedback loop runs continuously, refining decisions as conditions evolve.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **Learning and Adaptation**
    
    - Each agent employs **reinforcement learning (RL)** or **multi-agent RL** to improve policies over time:
      - For example, the Inventory Optimization Agent experiments with different reorder thresholds and safety stocks, measuring resulting costs and service levels.
      - The Negotiation Agent learns supplier responsiveness and cost tradeoffs to optimize contract terms.
    - Agents incorporate **probabilistic modeling** (e.g., Bayesian networks) to handle uncertainty in forecasts and supplier reliability.
    - Online learning from continuous feedback (actual demand, delays, costs) ensures adaptation to new patterns such as seasonal shifts or supply disruptions.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Advantages Over Traditional Approaches**
    
    | Traditional Approach                      | Agentic AI Solution                                                            |
    |------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Batch, rule-based or periodic forecasts  | Continuous, real-time dynamic forecasting and decision-making                    |
    | Isolated siloed decisions per node or function | Coordinated multi-agent negotiation optimizing global supply chain performance  |
    | Static safety stocks applied uniformly    | Dynamic, SKU/location-specific safety stocks adjusting proactively             |
    | Delayed human responses to disruptions   | Autonomous autonomous proactive responses with near-zero lag                   |
    | Limited adaptation to novel events        | Self-learning agents rapidly adapting to new patterns, disruptions, and risks  |
    
    ---
    
    ### 6. **Illustrative Use Case Flow**
    
    **Scenario:** Demand surges suddenly in Region A.
    
    1. Demand Sensing Agent flags +50% unexpected demand spike for SKU123.
    2. Inventory Optimization Agent prescribes 40% uplift in reorder quantity across warehouse, regional depots, and calls for expedited replenishment upstream.
    3. Supply Risk Agent flags that Supplier B has reduced capacity due to factory shutdown.
    4. Negotiation Agent contacts Supplier C to increase emergency allocation.
    5. Logistics Coordination Agent re-routes shipments using air freight instead of sea for critical batches.
    6. Warehouse Agent revises staging plans to prepare downstream warehouses for faster turnaround.
    7. Central Coordination Agent ensures decisions honor overall budget and service targets.
    8. Agents learn from subsequent fulfillment outcomes to refine future policies.
    
    ---
    
    ## Summary
    
    By architecting a **multi-agent AI system** that:
    
    - Continuously senses and forecasts demand and supply conditions,
    - Optimizes inventory holistically across nodes,
    - Autonomously negotiates with suppliers,
    - Dynamically manages logistics modes and routes,
    - And iteratively learns from outcomes,
    
    companies can drastically improve responsiveness, reduce excess costs, avoid stockouts, and boost customer satisfaction in complex, rapidly changing multi-echelon supply chains.
    
    This Agentic AI solution transforms rigid, siloed decision-making processes into an adaptive, collaborative, and far more efficient ecosystem — a true next-generation supply chain optimization framework.

### 2. **Data Inputs & Integration**

- **Real-time Data Sources:** POS sales, ERP stock levels, supplier order acknowledgments, transportation tracking systems, weather feeds, market indicators, social media sentiment analysis, geopolitical news.
- **Systems Integration:** Bi-directional API connections with ERP, Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), Transportation Management Systems (TMS), Supplier Portals.
- **Event Streams:** Agents consume event streams enabling reactive and proactive behavior rather than batch updates.

### 3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration and Decision Flow**

1. The **Demand Sensing Agent** detects an unexpected sales spike for SKU X in region R and alerts the Inventory Optimization Agent immediately.
2. The **Inventory Optimization Agent** re-runs optimization models considering updated forecasts, current inventories, demand uncertainty, and historical replenishment policies:
    - Calculates new order quantities and safety stocks per node.
    - Identifies potential bottlenecks (e.g., upstream constraints).
3. The **Supply Risk Agent** evaluates upstream suppliers for ability to meet suddenly increased order volumes:
    - Detects supplier delays or capacity shortfalls.
    - Suggests risk mitigating actions, e.g., alternative suppliers.
4. The **Negotiation & Contracting Agent** autonomously engages pertinent suppliers to expedite orders, negotiate priority slots, or request emergency shipments.
5. The **Logistics Coordination Agent** designs new inbound shipment plans:
    - Chooses faster transportation modes.
    - Prepares contingency routing plans.
6. The **Warehouse & Distribution Agent** recalculates allocation plans for downstream warehouses, preparing them to receive and distribute increased SKU volumes.
7. The **Central Coordination Agent** ensures agent decisions do not conflict and collectively maximize overall supply chain efficiency under the company’s cost-service tradeoff objective.

This feedback loop runs continuously, refining decisions as conditions evolve.

### 4. **Learning and Adaptation**

- Each agent employs **reinforcement learning (RL)** or **multi-agent RL** to improve policies over time:
  - For example, the Inventory Optimization Agent experiments with different reorder thresholds and safety stocks, measuring resulting costs and service levels.
  - The Negotiation Agent learns supplier responsiveness and cost tradeoffs to optimize contract terms.
- Agents incorporate **probabilistic modeling** (e.g., Bayesian networks) to handle uncertainty in forecasts and supplier reliability.
- Online learning from continuous feedback (actual demand, delays, costs) ensures adaptation to new patterns such as seasonal shifts or supply disruptions.

### 6. **Illustrative Use Case Flow**

**Scenario:** Demand surges suddenly in Region A.

1. Demand Sensing Agent flags +50% unexpected demand spike for SKU123.
2. Inventory Optimization Agent prescribes 40% uplift in reorder quantity across warehouse, regional depots, and calls for expedited replenishment upstream.
3. Supply Risk Agent flags that Supplier B has reduced capacity due to factory shutdown.
4. Negotiation Agent contacts Supplier C to increase emergency allocation.
5. Logistics Coordination Agent re-routes shipments using air freight instead of sea for critical batches.
6. Warehouse Agent revises staging plans to prepare downstream warehouses for faster turnaround.
7. Central Coordination Agent ensures decisions honor overall budget and service targets.
8. Agents learn from subsequent fulfillment outcomes to refine future policies.

## Summary

By architecting a **multi-agent AI system** that:

- Continuously senses and forecasts demand and supply conditions,
- Optimizes inventory holistically across nodes,
- Autonomously negotiates with suppliers,
- Dynamically manages logistics modes and routes,
- And iteratively learns from outcomes,

companies can drastically improve responsiveness, reduce excess costs, avoid stockouts, and boost customer satisfaction in complex, rapidly changing multi-echelon supply chains.

This Agentic AI solution transforms rigid, siloed decision-making processes into an adaptive, collaborative, and far more efficient ecosystem — a true next-generation supply chain optimization framework.
