## Welcome to Lab 3 for Week 1 Day 4

Today we're going to build something with immediate value!

In the folder `me` I've put a single file `linkedin.pdf` - it's a PDF download of my LinkedIn profile.

Please replace it with yours!

I've also made a file called `summary.txt`

We're not going to use Tools just yet - we're going to add the tool tomorrow.

<table style="margin: 0; text-align: left; width:100%">

        <td style="width: 150px; height: 150px; vertical-align: middle;">

            <span style="color:#00bfff;">In this lab, we're going to use the wonderful Gradio package for building quick UIs, 
            and we're also going to use the popular PyPDF PDF reader. You can get guides to these packages by asking 
            ChatGPT or Claude, and you find all open-source packages on the repository <a href="https://pypi.org">https://pypi.org</a>.

    Ed Donner
    Co-Founder & CTO at Nebula.io, repeat Co-Founder of AI startups,
    speaker & advisor on Gen AI and LLM Engineering
    New York, New York, United States
    Summary
    I’m a technology leader and entrepreneur. I'm applying AI to a field
    where it can make a massive impact: helping people discover their
    potential and pursue their reason for being. But at my core, I’m a
    software engineer and a scientist. I learned how to code aged 8 and
    still spend weekends experimenting with Large Language Models
    and writing code (rather badly). If you’d like to join us to show me
    how it’s done.. message me!
    As a work-hobby, I absolutely love giving talks about Gen AI and
    LLMs. I'm the author of a best-selling, top-rated Udemy course
    on LLM Engineering, and I speak at O'Reilly Live Events and
    ODSC workshops. It brings me great joy to help others unlock the
    astonishing power of LLMs.
    I spent most of my career at JPMorgan building software for financial
    markets. I worked in London, Tokyo and New York. I became an MD
    running a global organization of 300. Then I left to start my own AI
    business, untapt, to solve the problem that had plagued me at JPM -
    why is so hard to hire engineers?
    At untapt we worked with GQR, one of the world's fastest growing
    recruitment firms. We collaborated on a patented invention in AI
    and talent. Our skills were perfectly complementary - AI leaders vs
    recruitment leaders - so much so, that we decided to join forces. In
    2020, untapt was acquired by GQR’s parent company and Nebula
    was born.
    I’m now Co-Founder and CTO for Nebula, responsible for software
    engineering and data science.  Our stack is Python/Flask, React,
    Mongo, ElasticSearch, with Kubernetes on GCP. Our 'secret sauce'
    is our use of Gen AI and proprietary LLMs. If any of this sounds
    interesting - we should talk!

    Nebula.io
    Co-Founder & CTO
    June 2021 - Present (3 years 10 months)
    New York, New York, United States
    I’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula.io. We help recruiters source,
    understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI / proprietary
    LLMs. Our patented model matches people with roles with greater accuracy
    and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required.
    Our long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their
    reason for being, motivated by a concept called Ikigai. We help people find
    roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise
    the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people
    don’t consider themselves inspired or engaged at work, it’s completely within
    our reach.

    Our core invention is an Artificial Neural Network that uses Deep Learning /
    NLP to understand the fit between candidates and roles.
    Our SaaS products are used in the Recruitment Industry to connect people
    with jobs in a highly scalable way. Our products are also used by Corporations
    for internal and external hiring at high volume. We have strong SaaS metrics
    and trends, and a growing number of bellwether clients.
    Our Deep Learning / NLP models are developed in Python using Google
    TensorFlow. Our tech stack is React / Redux and Angular HTML5 front-end
    with Python / Flask back-end and MongoDB database. We are deployed on
    the Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes container orchestration.

def chat(message, history):

    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Special note for people not using OpenAI

Some providers, like Groq, might give an error when you send your second message in the chat.

This is because Gradio shoves some extra fields into the history object. OpenAI doesn't mind; but some other models complain.

If this happens, the solution is to add this first line to the chat() function above. It cleans up the history variable:

```python
history = [{"role": h["role"], "content": h["content"]} for h in history]
```

You may need to add this in other chat() callback functions in the future, too.
